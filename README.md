- Think of at least 2 independent features that your exercise will accomplish. For the sortable array, it could be sorting a list of integers and sorting a list of strings.

- Set up branches for each of these features; this means you must have at least three branches, including master.

## Branches

- ```main``` is being used as the ```master``` as creating a new repo via Github, create ```main``` as the default branch.

- ```setup_array``` is used to declare an empty array and testing the project initializing by printing it to the console.

- ```sorting_func``` is used to populate the empty array created in ```setup_array``` and implement the sorting functionality on the array.

## Git Commands

- ```git init```

- ```git checkout -b [new-branch-name]```

- ```git checkout [branch-name]```

- ```git push```

- ```git pull```

- ```git add [file-name | .]```

- ```git commit -m "commit-message"```

- ```git merge -m "merge-message```

## Environment Setup
